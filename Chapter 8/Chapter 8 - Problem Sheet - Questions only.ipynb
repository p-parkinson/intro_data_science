In a counting experiment, assume that the hypothesis is that the expected count rate is 30. Make a table for counts 0 to 50 with the following columns (if you're not using a computer and calculate the numbers one-by-one, you may start at a count of 15; note also that one of the parts of the Poisson probability formula does not depend on the count):\n",
